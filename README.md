# About

This is a sample app we made to allow technical exercises to happen the best way possible.

All the resources needed to run and test the app will be provided by GitHub Codespaces.

This means you don't need to run the project locally nor configure your dev environment for it.

You don't need more than your browser to accomplish this exercise, but we recommend you use VS Code.

VS Code will improve the experience while the app runs at GitHub Codespaces.


## How to run the project

- Go to Code button > Codespaces > New codespace > Select machine type (2-core should be enough).
- Here's a quick recording on how that works...

- You should be able to run `bin/dev` to run the server on port 5000 and `bin/rspec` to run the test suite.

## How to submit your test

- Do not push a branch to remote since you're branch can be seen by other candidates.
- When you are finished create a [git patch](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/create-and-apply-patch)
- Once you are finished please schedule a time on my calendar for us to discuss the solution - https://calendly.com/postpilot-matt/30min and send me an email with the patch attached.
