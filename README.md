# About

This is a sample app we made to allow technical exercises to happen the best way possible.

All the resources needed to run and test the app can be provided by GitHub Codespaces.

Follow the PDF instructions you recieved to complete the assessed task. 

Remember to focus on code quality, sound decision making, and clarity of communication.

## How to run the project on GitHub Codespaces
- Go to Code button > Codespaces > New codespace > Select machine type (2-core should be enough).
- Here's a quick recording on how that works...

- Either on browser or VSCode, you will end up in a shell console, from there you can run all the Rails commands you may already be used to.
- Probably because of the containers, you may need to run commands with `sudo`:
  - `sudo bundle install`
  - `sudo rails db:setup`
  - `sudo bin/dev` to run the server
  - `sudo bin/rspec` to run the test suite

## How to run the project locally
- You should be able to achieve that at this point 😄

## How to submit your test

- Do not push a branch to remote since other candidates can see your branch.
- Once you are finished:
  1. Create a private repo
  2. Share access with the users listed on the [submission form](https://forms.gle/zjXmQbUyJ6LVJJyw7)
  3. Message your point of contact (recruiter, hiring manager, etc)
